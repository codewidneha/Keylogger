# 🔑 **Keylogger** 🔑

A simple and efficient keylogger designed to capture and log keystrokes. This project includes a **basic keylogger** that only captures keystrokes, and an **advanced keylogger** that captures screenshots, records the screen, and sends the logs to the authorities. This project is intended for educational purposes only. Please use responsibly and ensure you have proper permissions before use.

## 🔑 **Keylogger Types**

### **1. Basic Keylogger**
The basic keylogger captures only the keystrokes pressed by the user. It’s lightweight and ideal for simple logging applications.

### **2. Advanced Keylogger**
The advanced keylogger not only captures keystrokes but also:
- Takes periodic **screenshots** of the user’s screen.
- **Records the screen** for further analysis.
- **Emails** the collected data (keystrokes, screenshots, and screen recordings) to a predefined recipient (such as the authorities).

## 🏥 **Frontend Visualizations**

In this project, I’ve also created two additional frontends to enhance the user experience:

1. **AuthApp Login Page**: A login page to test and visualize the keylogger functionality in a more interactive manner.
2. **Medicare Hospital Frontend**: A frontend interface for a hospital management system, aimed at providing a better visualization experience while interacting with the keylogger.
