🔑 Keylogger Types
1. Basic Keylogger
The basic keylogger captures only the keystrokes pressed by the user. It’s lightweight and ideal for simple logging applications.

2. Advanced Keylogger
The advanced keylogger not only captures keystrokes but also:

Takes periodic screenshots of the user’s screen.
Records the screen for further analysis.
Emails the collected data (keystrokes, screenshots, and screen recordings) to a predefined recipient (such as the authorities).
🏥 Frontend Visualizations
In this project, I’ve also created two additional frontends to enhance the user experience:

AuthApp Login Page: A login page to test and visualize the keylogger functionality in a more interactive manner.
Medicare Hospital Frontend: A frontend interface for a hospital management system, aimed at providing a better visualization experience while interacting with the keylogger.
